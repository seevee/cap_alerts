"""Per-source convention table — declarative interpretive rules (issue #82).

A *convention* is an encoding that is true for one alert source and meaningless
everywhere else: which area-code prefixes denote water, which lifecycle token
means "this is over", how a source spells severity. They are not CAP 1.2; they
are local habits layered on top of it.

The governing split is **parse faithfully, interpret separately**. Providers and
``providers/cap.py`` reproduce what a feed actually published, losing nothing;
this module holds the interpretation applied on top. That keeps the shared CAP
parser spec-pure — safe for every provider to reuse — and keeps ``normalize.py``
source-agnostic, since it consults the table rather than hard-coding one
source's vocabulary.

The pattern mirrors ``model.GEOCODE_SCHEME_ALIASES``: conventions are *data*, so
adding a source is a table entry rather than a new branch in shared code, and a
source that publishes no such signal simply omits the field instead of being
silently absent from an ``if`` somewhere.

Entries are keyed by source, **not** by provider. A single provider can carry
several dialects — MeteoAlarm relays every EUMETNET member, and MeteoFrance
alone needs its own identity, green-marker, and episode handling — so
``conventions_for()`` resolves ``provider/sender`` before falling back to
``provider``. A sender-scoped entry *replaces* the provider's rather than
layering on top of it, so it restates every rule it still wants: the
MeteoFrance entry repeats the MeteoAlarm severity derivation for that reason.

Where two senders share a shape but not its details, the *difference* becomes
data rather than a second implementation. Both MeteoFrance and FMI split one
continuous episode across several messages, so both declare an
``EpisodeDialect``; all they disagree on is what makes consecutive messages one
episode (a run of forecast days vs. a run of touching windows), so that
predicate is the declared field and the rest of the pipeline is shared.

Two hook shapes cover what a dialect can do. Most rules are per-alert
callables — ``severity``, ``identity``, ``keep`` — and stay pure functions of
one alert. The two that cannot be (splitting one message into several,
collapsing several into one) are list-shaped ``PipelineStage`` entries bound to
a named slot in the fetch. The provider owns the order and decides where the
slots sit; conventions declare stages, they never reorder the fetch:

    construct → [identity] → [explode] → [keep] → mode filters → [merge] → return

Every constraint in that order is load-bearing:

* **identity** first — it feeds entity ids, and everything downstream keys on
  them.
* **explode** before **keep** — markers are dropped per exploded region.
* **keep** before the provider's mode filters, so all three MeteoAlarm modes
  are equally protected.
* **merge** last, immediately before the fetch returns. It must precede the
  alert store, which keys incoming alerts by id and would silently drop one of
  any pair sharing the window-free id the merge produces.

    ``expires`` is the replacement's issue time) and ``expires == onset``
    (zero-length). Both are non-warnings, but they carry the same ``event``
    text, ``awareness_type``, and areas as the real bulletin for that
    department-day — and ``episode_id`` deliberately excludes severity, so
    a marker and the bulletin it refers to hash to the *same* id. The alert
    store keys incoming alerts by id, so whichever arrives last wins and the
    real warning can be silently displaced by a green one (issue #37).

    The ``>`` is load-bearing and must not be "tidied" to ``>=``: the

    absent and is retained ``stale`` until its published expiry (end of the

    the marker cannot be forwarded as a terminal record, because the
    zero-length shape routinely coexists with a *live* bulletin of the same
    episode (a green day alongside a warned day), so treating any marker as
    termination would end running warnings — the displacement bug of issue #37
