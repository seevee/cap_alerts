"""MeteoAlarm (EUMETNET) per-country JSON warnings feed provider.

Uses the aggregate JSON endpoint
(``feeds.meteoalarm.org/api/v1/warnings/feeds-{country-slug}``) which ships
proper CAP-1.2 ``info`` blocks (multi-language) and per-area geocodes. Feeds
carry a mix of area-geocode schemes across countries (``EMMA_ID``, ``NUTS3``,
``NUTS2``, ``WARNCELLID``, ``CISORP``); some countries carry two at once and
some none (polygon-only). Geocodes are collected into the scheme-keyed
``CAPAlert.geocodes`` container rather than a single named field.

Three filter modes selectable via config-flow:

* country-wide — all warnings for the configured country.
* gps-polygon — parses ``area.polygon`` from each warning and keeps only
  warnings whose polygon contains the configured point. Fails loud when a
  non-empty warnings page contains zero polygons (the country does not
  publish per-warning geometry).
* region-picker — keeps warnings whose region codes intersect the configured
  region selection. Region codes are resolved from ``geocodes`` by scheme
  priority (``METEOALARM_REGION_SCHEMES``) so a country's coarsest
  administrative scheme (e.g. ``EMMA_ID`` for DE, ``NUTS3`` for FR) is what
  both the picker offers and the filter matches.

The picker list itself is derived from the warnings feed. No usable regions
endpoint exists: ``feeds.meteoalarm.org/api/v1/regions/feeds-{slug}`` is 404
for all 38 countries, the official successor ``api.meteoalarm.org/metadata/v1``
needs a re-user API key, and the public endpoint behind meteoalarm.org's own
map keys areas by internal UUID rather than by any CAP geocode. Deriving from
warnings is not the fallback it reads as — members publish green/no-warning
entries for every area, so a live feed enumerates the country's full
administrative tree (measured 2026-08-04: DE 408 regions, PL 383, ES 233).

An area may publish several region codes under a single ``areaDesc`` — FMI
names four sea areas in one string — so ``_region_entries`` offers every code of
the area's scheme and labels each from the most specific honest source
available: per-code names when the description zips 1:1 with the codes, the
block name qualified by the code when it carries a single name, the bare code
otherwise. Harvesting reads one ``<info>`` block per warning, chosen by
language, because a feed whose areas carry no region-selectable scheme falls
back to ``areaDesc`` — there the code *is* the label, so reading every block
would offer each region once per published language.
