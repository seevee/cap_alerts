"""GDACS (Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System) provider.

GDACS is **not a weather service**. It publishes geophysical hazards
(earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis) alongside meteorological and hydrological
ones (cyclones, floods, droughts, wildfires), which is why this provider
exists — the model is a CAP model, not a weather model.

Unlike every other provider here, no CAP document is ever fetched. GDACS has no
per-event CAP endpoint that works (probed 2026-08-08):

* ``cap.aspx`` reads only its ``eventtype`` parameter. Four different
  ``eventid`` values of one type all returned the same body, so every
  earthquake in a poll resolved to whichever earthquake was newest — distinct
  ids carrying identical content, one entity per index item, all of them
  wrong. Adding ``episodeid`` does not change it.
* The per-event path each RSS item advertises in ``<gdacs:cap>`` is real but
  partial: cyclones have one, and every earthquake and flood answered HTTP 200
  with the GDACS "Admin section" HTML page. There is no 404 to detect.

So the RSS item *is* the record. Every item carries the same 41 fields across
all six hazard types, including a per-episode identity, the alert level, and
the timestamps — enough for a ``CAPAlert``, with per-event geometry fetched
separately from the GeoJSON the item's episode names. That makes GDACS the
second provider (after NWS, which reads GeoJSON) to build alerts without a CAP
parser; ``CAPAlert`` is the target shape, not the wire format.

Two consequences worth stating plainly:

**Nothing here ever gets an ``expires``.** ``<gdacs:todate>`` looks like one and
is not: it was in the past for all 315 events in a sampled current-events feed,
including all three live cyclones and all 280 live wildfires. It is the last
observation time. Mapping it to ``expires`` would mark every GDACS alert
terminal on arrival, so it travels in ``parameters`` instead.

**Withdrawal from the feed is the only end-of-life signal.** ``iscurrent`` goes
false for droughts and nothing else — every earthquake, volcano, cyclone, flood
and wildfire observed was ``iscurrent=true`` right up to the poll where it
disappeared. With no ``expires``, no terminal vocabulary and no termination
lookup, ``store._retain_on_absence`` already ends these alerts the moment they
go missing, which is the correct reading of this feed. Retention therefore
scales with significance: a major earthquake holds an entity for about four
days, a small one about a day, a drought for a year. See ``const`` for the two
indexes that produce that and why both are polled.
