    ``lifecycle_status`` is the provider-supplied termination hint (see
    ``CAPAlert.lifecycle_status``). Some feeds never signal end-of-life through
    ``msgType`` — ECCC keeps ``Update`` and marks the area group ``ended`` in a
    CAP parameter instead, leaving an hour of ``expires`` still on the clock —
    so a terminal status retires the alert regardless of ``msg_type``.

    The two terminal phases are not interchangeable, and which one applies is
    decided by the clock rather than by the signal that revealed it (issue #95):

    * ``expired`` — the alert ran to its ``expires`` timestamp. Checked first,
      so an alert already past its expiry stays ``expired`` even if the feed
      also marks it ended.
    * ``cancel`` — the alert ended before that timestamp. A consumer cannot
      infer this from ``expires`` alone, which is exactly why it has to survive
      into the event payload: ending early is news, reaching a published expiry
      is not.

    This mirrors ``store._infer_terminal_phase``, which already calls a silently
    vanished alert ``cancel`` when its ``expires`` is still in the future. A
    provider that *announces* an early end must not land on a worse phase than
    one that simply drops the record.

    ``terminal_statuses`` comes from the source's convention table entry — its
    ``lifecycle_removal_reasons``, whose keys are the terminal tokens and whose
    values say why the alert went away (``store`` publishes those as
    ``removal_reason``; only the keys matter here). Scoping it to the source
    means one feed's vocabulary can never retire another's alerts. Values
    outside it — including the empty default every source without such a signal
    supplies — fall through unchanged.
