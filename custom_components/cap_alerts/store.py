        ``scope_changed`` says this reconciliation asked a *different question*
        than the last one — the tracker crossed a border, a zone was
        reconfigured, the marine toggle was flipped. Retention compares like
        with like, so it is suspended for that cycle: an alert missing because
        the user moved out of its area has not gone unobserved, it has gone out
        of scope, and holding it to its expiry would strand a warning from a
        place the user has left.

        Accepts the *unfiltered* normalized list so terminal-phase alerts
        (``cancel``/``expired``) can fire ``incident_removed`` with their
        true terminal phase (RFC §2.3) before being dropped from the
        returned active set. Alerts that disappear silently between polls
        are inferred as ``expired`` if their ``expires`` timestamp is in
        the past, otherwise ``cancel``.

        Each ending is announced once. A terminal record that stays in the feed
        is reconciled again every cycle, and every one of those reconciliations
        used to fire ``incident_removed`` (issue #145); the id is tombstoned
        instead, and a repeat sighting of the same ending is a no-op. An id that
        comes back *live* clears its tombstone and fires ``incident_created``,
        because a reissue is news and swallowing it is worse than a duplicate.

        The same ending can also reappear under a *different* id: a source may
        re-issue an already-ended record on a new revision (issue #185). The
        id-keyed tombstone above cannot recognise that, so a terminal alert
        whose ``references`` name the CAP identifier of an already-tombstoned
        ending is treated the same way — suppressed, and its own id and
        identifier folded into the tombstone so a third revision is caught too.

        Returns only the active alerts (``phase`` ∈ ``{new, update}``),
        with ``previous_phase`` and ``phase_changed`` set.

    message cannot tell that the successor's ``incident_created`` is already
    carrying the news. The distinction survives on ``lifecycle_status``, which

    Deliberately independent of the terminal ``phase``: ``transitioned_out``
    documents are issued with ``expires`` at or before ``sent``, so most of them
    normalize to ``expired`` rather than ``cancel`` — gating this on ``cancel``
    would drop the reason in exactly the upgrade case it exists for.

    """Whether an alert missing from this reconciliation should be kept.

    Absence is an observation, not an announcement. Two sanctioned endpoints of
    one national feed have been measured disagreeing about which alerts are
    live (RFC §2.5), and NWS never publishes a cancellation to the endpoint the
    provider polls — cancellations land on a different one entirely, which is
    why the NWS provider fetches them separately. So an alert vanishing between
    reconciliations means either "it ended" or "we failed to see it", and
    nothing in the observation itself distinguishes them.

    Retaining costs a stale warning until its published expiry. Terminating
    costs a live hazard silently cleared from the dashboard, followed by a
    *new* incident when the feed recovers, because an id that left the tracked
    set comes back unrecognized — the history fragmentation of RFC §1.2,
    self-inflicted. The second is worse, so absence alone does not terminate.

    The one thing that makes absence itself authoritative is the source's
    declared convention: ``ABSENCE_ENDS`` says withdrawing a record is
    genuinely how this source announces the end. It is a property of the
    source's contract, not of any one message, which is why an alert that
    merely *omits* ``expires`` is not terminated on that basis alone.

    **Retention requires an exit.** Keeping an alert is only safe if something
    can eventually end it, and an alert with no expiry has ruled out the
    obvious candidate. Two others remain, both declared in the convention
    table: a terminal vocabulary the source publishes
    (``lifecycle_removal_reasons``), or a provider that goes and fetches
    terminations the active feed omits (``discovers_terminations``). With
    none of the three, retention has no way to end and the entity would
    outlive the hazard by an unbounded margin — so absence stays authoritative
    for exactly that case.

    This is not hypothetical. Across 113 WMO authorities serving CAP, 20 of
    510 ``<info>`` blocks published no ``<expires>`` at all, and for two of
    them — Macao and Curaçao — it was every single alert, with nothing in the
    RSS envelope to fall back on. WMO declares no terminal vocabulary and has
    no termination lookup, so retaining those would have meant entities that
    never go away for whole countries. Deriving the rule from the table rather
    than naming those senders keeps it true for the next such source.

    Resolved per sender, not per provider, because sender-scoped convention
    entries *replace* the provider's (see ``conventions_for``) and a dialect
    must be able to carry its own absence policy.
